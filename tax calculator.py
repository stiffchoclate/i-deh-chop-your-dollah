"""take income and income type(pre-conditions). store in a 2d array (do recursively until no more sources required.)
make it robust (e.g. use while loop to get correct data types(this is data validation)). 
use map function to apply the correct tax bracket to each income source and return tax tb paid. add deductions at the end. 
store all of this is another array that relates. could this be done ++ efficiently using a relational DB.
at the end display to  the user all the income sources and their according taxes;
